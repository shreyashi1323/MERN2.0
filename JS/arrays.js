// Js in array copy operation creates shallow copies rather tha DEEP COPIES
// SHALLOW COPIES :- shallow copy of an object is a copy whose
// properties share the same references as those of the source object from which the copy was made.
//  as a result , when u change either the source or the copy , you may also cause the other object to change too.
